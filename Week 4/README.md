# DH150-Observation-Study and Contextual Inquiry


## The main design challenge: 

The main design challenge would be to navigate the different sections of the restaurant, figure out what cuisine is served at each restaurant, figure out the hours, and accordingly make a reservation for a date. 
The basic need that this activity would fulfill is a sense of social belonging. Going out to exclusive places like this with others fosters a sense of intimacy with whoever you are going with as you both are experiencing a novel and unique place together. It can also temporarily take away feelings of loneliness. This need is also traditionally satisfied through attending other social gatherings or spots, interactions on social media, or simply meeting people who are already part of your social circle. 


## Target users:

The target user is whoever is either resides in London or is planning to visit the city and is open to the idea of visiting Sketch. This would also include high-end dining enthusiasts who want to try out the exclusive destinations in the city. Since we are working with the desktop version of the website, the target user would also be those who use their laptops or computers more than their phones, so it would not include younger teenagers or young adults since they use their phones more. The users could complete the activity wherever they have access to a digital device, so that they can access the website. All they would have to do is play around with the website, explore the different sections for the different areas, read through the menus, figure out what they would like the most, check out the opening hours, and finally make a reservation for two. 



## The observation method:

I will conduct the research through participatory observation. I kept asking questions and taking notes, but I didnâ€™t interfere in their search tasks.

## Short reflection on what I learned and what I will do differently in the future:

My participant is intending on studying abroad in London next quarter and was open to the idea of visiting sketch, so he seemed like the perfect person to carry out the study with. He was a lot more patient and more accepting than the participant I used for the Usability Test, so the results were more positive this time. However, he did face many hurdles while trying to navigate the website. He was trying to check out all the areas of the restaurant, see their menus, and then proceeded to check their opening hours to make a reservation. During his search tasks, there were many glitches, unnecessary pop-ups, and awkward audio playing, which slowed him down and made him take longer than normal to find the menus of a restaurant. He is also a gamer so he appreciated the interactive game tools on the website. Overall, although he found many flaws with the website, he was so overwhelmed with the games and the graphics that he was too distracted to be critical. I am sure that if I had asked him to use the website one more time he would be more frustrated.
