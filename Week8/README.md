# High Fidelity Prototype

Here is the [link](https://www.figma.com/proto/yuwr7G10iibhDk65hvyMmD/sketch-London?node-id=2%3A0&scaling=min-zoom) to my interactive prototype. 

Here are a list of tasks that the prototype supports:
1.	Checking out the gallery 
2.	Making a reservation for a party of 2 on Jan 2nd at the parlor (7:00PM)
3.	Checking out the special events at sketch 

The choice of my color scheme was dependent on what colors popped up the most when I researched pictures of sketch on the Internet. I mostly saw hues of light pink, with pops of darker pink and purple, which is why I went for those colors mostly. It gives it a clean, feminine, and fashionable look. I also considered the accessibility color contrast and ensured it was within the normal range, because it is important that the websiteâ€™s looks is user friendly and appealing.
